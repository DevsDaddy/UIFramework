![image](https://github.com/DevsDaddy/UIFramework/assets/147835900/f8ddf1a0-fddd-44fb-af51-a863af6fca8b)
**Unity UI Framework** - A set of tools for interface developers, ready to use in your projects and supporting the **MVC/MVP/MVVVM** patterns. 
The basic architecture works based on **View and Layouts**, and interaction is handled by an **event system** to make your interface logic independent.

**Dependencies:**
- <a href="https://github.com/DevsDaddy/UnityEventFramework">Unity Event Framework</a> (included in project);
- Unity UI (UGUI);

**Features:**
- Ready for MVP/MVC/MVVM;
- Views and Layouts loading from Prefab / Resources / Addressables;
- UI Controller for Views Management and Navigation;
- Binding / Unbinging Events;
- UI Particle System and UI Shaders;
- Optimized for every platform;

**Examples:**
You can see this framework in action - <a href="https://github.com/DevsDaddy/OneUIKit">check out the One UI collection</a> - a ready-to-go interface and set of components for your apps and games based on the **Unity UI Framework**

## Get Started
**Unity UI Framework** is designed for your application and games using Unity UI (UGUI) and support Unity 2018+.

**Installation process:**
- Download and import <a href="https://github.com/DevsDaddy/UIFramework/releases">latest release from this page</a>;
- See <a href="#usage">usage examples below</a>;

## How it works?

The **UI Framework** works according to the **View** / **Navigation** / **Layouts** scheme. And separates entities between them. 
Each **screen or window** is a **View** that is stored in history for navigation. Each View can have its own unlimited number of **Layouts**. 
**One of the View must be the home View for navigation**.
